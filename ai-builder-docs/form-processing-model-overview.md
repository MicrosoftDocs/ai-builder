# Preview: Overview of form processing model

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

AI Builder form processing allows you to create AI models that use machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents.

[Train](train-model.md) your model and define the information to be extracted from your forms. You only need five form documents to get started. Quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content. With AI Builder, you don't need a lot of manual intervention, or data science expertise.

After you train and [publish](publish-model.md) your model, you can use it in the AI Builder [form processor control](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md) in Power Apps canvas, or in [Power Automate](form-processing-model-in-flow.md).
