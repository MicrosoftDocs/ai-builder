# Overview of the document processing model

Document processing lets you read and save information from standard documents such as invoices or tax documents. When you automate this process, you can save valuable time by reviewing, extracting, organizing, and saving the data automatically by using Power Automate and Power Apps.

[Train](train-model.md) your model and define the information to be extracted from your forms. You only need five form documents to get started. Quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content. With AI Builder, you don't need a lot of manual intervention or data science expertise.

After you train and [publish](publish-model.md) your model, you can use it in a flow in [Power Automate](form-processing-model-in-flow.md) or in a canvas app in [Power Apps](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md).

 > [!NOTE]
 > Document processing name used to be form processing until June 2022.
