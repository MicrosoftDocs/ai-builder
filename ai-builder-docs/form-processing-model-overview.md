# Document processing model overview

Document processing lets you read and save information from standard documents such as invoices or tax documents. When you automate this process, you can save valuable time by reviewing, extracting, organizing, and saving the data automatically by using [Power Automate](form-processing-model-in-flow.md) and [Power Apps](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md).

Before you can use the document processing model, you need to *train* and *publish* your model.

- [Train](train-model.md) your model and define the information to be extracted from your documents. You only need five documents to get started. Quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content. With AI Builder, you don't need much manual intervention or data science expertise.
- After you train and [publish](publish-model.md) your model, you can use it in a cloud flow in [Power Automate](form-processing-model-in-flow.md) or in a canvas app in [Power Apps](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md).
