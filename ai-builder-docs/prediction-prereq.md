# Prediction model prerequisites

For information about AI Builder requirements that aren't specific to this AI model, go to [AI model prerequisites](build-model.md#prerequisites).

## What skills do I need?

- The person creating the prediction model should know enough about the business in question to understand the meaning of a dataset.

- Because you don't need coding skills to create an AI model in AI Builder, you don't need to be a developer or data scientist to use the AI Builder prediction model. If you aren't familiar with a certain concept, select the **View documentation** or **Help** links in AI Builder.

## What data do I need?

- Your data must be in [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

- Make sure your administrator has assigned you a security role with Read privilege over your data.

- You need at least 10 rows of historical outcome for each class of the **Label** data column to train a prediction model.

- The minimum for training is 50 rows, but for best results you should have at least 1,000 rows.

## Work with sample data

To help you get started quickly with prediction, AI Builder provides sample data that you can use to get started. For more information, go to [Use sample data to do prediction](prediction-sample-data.md).
