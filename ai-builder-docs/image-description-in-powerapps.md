The image description prebuilt model analyzes an image and generates a user-friendly description based on its analysis. Use it when your app needs to describe an image or other visual element.

## Explore image description

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the left navigation pane, select **More** > **AI models** > **New AI model**.

1. Under **AI Models > Explore**, select **Image description**.

1. Select an image sample or select **Upload new** and select your own image file.

1. To add the prebuilt model to a sample app, select **Use prebuilt model** > **Use in an app**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/image-description-in-powerapps/use-in-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Generate description of an image page, with the Use in an app button highlighted.":::

1. Select the **Play** icon in the upper-right corner.

1. Select **Tap or click to add a picture**, and then select an image file on your device.

## Use the formula bar to add the model to an app

Another way to integrate the AI Builder image description model in your app is to use the formula bar. Enter a formula similar to the following example, where *UploadedImage1* is the image container:

`'Image description'.Predict(UploadedImage1.Image)`
