# Publish your category classification model

When you're satisfied with your model, you can publish it. After it's published, your model is ready to run on your Microsoft Dataverse data or be used through Power Automate. It can take up to two hours for the results to be available.

In the **Model settings** pane on the right side of the screen, you can turn on Dataverse and get important information about where the suggested tags will be stored.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Currently, you can only schedule Dataverse runs by using the input table and column that you used for training. AI Builder creates a destination table where the model will store the suggested tags and their confidence scores. This destination table will have an N:1 (many-to-one) relationship with your source/input table.
> - AI Builder uses Power Automate to schedule and run tagging on your data. When you publish your model to run on your Dataverse data, this will use Power Automate runs from your subscription.

More information: [Publish your model in AI Builder](publish-model.md)

## Where will suggested tags be stored?

The following table will be created when you publish a model: **TC_{*Model_Name*}**

Tags will be stored in a column called **new_Tags** under this table.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the character limitation of the column name, if the provided syntax creates text that is over the character limit, AI Builder cuts off the end of the text. This means that the model name might be incomplete or missing. You should choose shorter names so everything is visible.
