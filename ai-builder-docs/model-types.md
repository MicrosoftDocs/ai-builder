# AI models and business scenarios

In AI Builder, you can choose from several model types that are suited to different business scenarios. Here are some examples:

- If you want to use intelligence to detect your products in images, you can refine a *custom* AI Builder object detection model. With a customizable model, you'll build, train, and publish it for your intended use.

- If you want to use intelligence to automate your expense reports by scanning and processing business receipts, you can use a *prebuilt* AI Builder receipt scanning model. All prebuilt models allow you to go straight to productivity.

- If you want to design a marketing campaign based on patterns in your historical data, you can use a *custom* prediction model tailored to your business, using your own historical data.

These models are only a few of the ways you can use AI Builder to add intelligence to your business processes.

To build a model with AI Builder:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) or [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. On the left pane, select **... More** > **AI hub**.
1. Under **Discover an AI capability**, select **AI models**.

    *(Optional)* To keep **AI models** permanently on the menu for easy access, select the pin icon.

1. On the right pane, select the model type that matches what you want to do. You're ready to get started.

## Model types

The following table lists the data type, models type, and build type. 

- **Data type**: Describes the type of AI that the models use (for example, documents, text, structured data, or images). 

- **Build type**: Indicates whether it’s a customizable model that you'll need to build, train, and publish for your intended use, or if it's a prebuilt model that’s ready to use. In general, use *custom* AI Builder models for applications where you're working with data that’s unique to your business. Use *prebuilt* models for scenarios that are common across different types of businesses.

[Common business scenarios](#common-business-scenarios) and the model types that are suited to them are described later in this topic.
