# AI models and business scenarios

In AI Builder, you can choose from several model types that are suited to different business scenarios. Here are some examples:

- If you want to use intelligence to detect your products in images, you can refine a *custom* AI Builder object detection model. With a customizable model, you'll build, train, and publish it for your intended use.

- If you want to use intelligence to automate your expense reports by scanning and processing business receipts, you can use a *prebuilt* AI Builder receipt scanning model. All prebuilt models allow you to go straight to productivity.

- If you want to design a marketing campaign based on patterns in your historical data, you can use a *custom* prediction model tailored to your business, using your own historical data.

These models are only a few of the ways you can use AI Builder to add intelligence to your business processes.

To build a model with AI Builder:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) or [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

1. On the left pane, select **AI Builder** > **Explore**.

1. On the right pane, select the model type that matches what you want to do. Then, you're ready to get started.

## Model types

The following table lists the data type, models type, and build type. 

- The *data type* describes the type of AI that the models use (for example, documents, text, structured data, or images). 

- The *build type* indicates whether it’s a customizable model that you'll need to build, train, and publish for your intended use, or if it's a prebuilt model that’s ready to use. In general, use *custom* AI Builder models for applications where you're working with data that’s unique to your business. Use *prebuilt* models for scenarios that are common across different types of businesses.

[Common business scenarios](#common-business-scenarios) and the model types that are suited to them are described later in this topic.
