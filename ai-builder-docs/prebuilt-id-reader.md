# ID reader prebuilt model

You can use the identity document (ID) reader prebuilt model to extract information from passports and US driver licenses, social security, and green cards. The model will extract information such as the person’s first name, date of birth, or gender.

Images such as scans or pictures of the identity documents are deleted once processed by the model.

> [!NOTE]
> - The design and format of identity documents vary widely. AI Builder is constantly improving the accuracy of the ID reader prebuilt model, but it's possible there could be inaccurate or missing information in some cases. It's a good idea to verify that the output is as you expect.
> - The ID reader prebuilt model only supports Latin character extraction at this time.
