# Use your prediction model in Power Apps

This topic takes you through the process of creating a model-driven app that can sort your rows by the probability value in the AI model output.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about model-driven apps, see [What are model-driven apps in Power Apps?](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. Select **Apps** from the pane on the left.

1. Select **New app** > **Model-driven** from the menu at the top.

1. On the **Create a New App** screen, complete the fields, and then select **Done**.

1. On the **App Designer** screen, do the following:
   1.  Create a view of your table that contains the predicted columns from the prediction model output.
   1. Add the view to the site map.

1. On the **Components** tab, select **Entities**, select your table, and then select **Back**.

1. Select **Save** at the top of the screen so that you don't lose your progress when you create a view.

1. Under **Entity view**, select **Views**, and then on the **Components** tab, select **Create New**.

1. On the **Components** tab, select **Column Attributes – Primary Entity**, and then select the columns generated by prediction output.

1. Select **Save And Close**, give your view a name, and then select the view you created.

1. Select **Save** again.

1. Select the pencil icon next to **Site Map** and rename **New Group** appropriately.

1. Select **New Subarea** and select **Entity** as the **Type**, and then select your table from the **Entity** drop-down menu.

1. Select **Save And Close**, and then select **Publish**.

1. Select **Play**. Your output should look something like the following image.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model-driven app complete screen](media/model-driven-app-scr.png "Model-driven app complete screen")

Congratulations, you've created your first model-driven app that uses an AI Builder prediction model.
