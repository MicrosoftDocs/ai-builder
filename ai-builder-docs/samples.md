# Start using AI Builder with sample data

Don't have any data of your own to create a model? No problem! We've got you covered.

Sample data is available for several AI Builder model types, together with instructions for working with the sample data. To get started, select one of the following options:

- [Use sample data to do prediction](prediction-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do category classification](text-classification-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do entity extraction](entity-extraction-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do object detection](object-detection-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do document processing](form-processing-sample-data.md)

## Build AI-powered canvas apps with sample data and prompts

The solution includes sample data, canvas apps, prompts, and tables for several AI Builder apps. Each option comes with detailed instructions to guide you through using these components together. To get started, select one of the following options.

- [Create a canvas app to develop a receipt reader that utilizes prompts](use-prompt-to-read-a-receipt.md)
