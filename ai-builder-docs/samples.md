# Start using AI Builder with sample data

Don't have any data of your own to create a model? No problem! We've got you covered.

- [Use sample data to do prediction](prediction-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do category classification](text-classification-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do object detection](object-detection-sample-data.md)
- [Use sample data to do form processing](form-processing-sample-data.md)
