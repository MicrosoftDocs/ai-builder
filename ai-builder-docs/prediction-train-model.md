# Train and publish your prediction model

Before you can use your prediction model, you have to train it to perform the way you want. After you train your model, publish it to make it available.

## Train

After you've selected your data fields, select **Next** to view a summary of training information. Then<!--no comma via Writing Style Guide.--> select **Train** to train your model.

> [!NOTE]
> Training takes time, so you can stay on the page and wait, or you can close the page and come back later.

## Publish

After the model is trained, you can [evaluate](manage-model.md#evaluate-your-model) its performance. Then [publish](publish-model.md) your model to start running predictions. After that, predictions run daily.
