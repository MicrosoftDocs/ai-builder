# Tag documents

By tagging the documents you uploaded, you're teaching your AI Builder model to extract the fields and tables you specified.

To start tagging, select one of the collections on the right panel.

## Tag fields

To tag a field, draw a rectangle around the field you're interested in and select the field name that it corresponds to.

:::image type="content" source="media/form-processing-multiple-layout-tag-fields.gif" alt-text="Animation of tagging fields in a document.":::

At any time, you can resize to adjust your selection.

If a field ends on one line and begins on another line, you can tag it using the **Continue tagging** option.

:::image type="content" source="media/document-processing-continue-tagging-doc.gif" alt-text="Animation of tagging multiple words and line breaks.":::

You can also use the **Control** key in Windows or **Command ⌘** in macOS to tag multiple words at once. You can use the **Shift** key to select the first and last word to tag all words between the two.

When you hover over words in your documents, light blue boxes might appear. These indicate that you can draw a rectangle around those words to select a field.

### For the custom invoices model only

You can override the behavior of a default field by redrawing an existing bounding box.

:::image type="content" source="media/invoice-override-fields.png" alt-text="Screenshot of overriding behavior of a default field.":::

Invoice default fields that weren't automatically detected in your document are marked as 'Not in document'. You can change this to **Available in document** and manually tag it if it's present.

:::image type="content" source="media/invoice-available-document.png" alt-text="Screenshot of field available in document.":::

When tagging, select **Custom** to display the list of untagged fields you added, and select **Default** to display the untagged default fields marked as 'Available in the document'.

### Tag tables

1. Draw a rectangle around the table in the document you're interested in, and then select the table name that it corresponds to. The content of the panel on the right changes.

1. Draw *rows* by left-clicking between row separators.
1. Draw *columns* by pressing **Ctrl** + left-click.
1. Once the rows and columns are set, assign the headers to extract by selecting the header column and mapping it to the desired one.

    A preview of how the table will be extracted appears on the panel on the right.

1. If the header of the table is tagged, select **Ignore first row** so the header of the table isn't extracted as the table content.

    The following animation illustrates the process:

Alternatively, define the rows and columns for a table by selecting **Delimit rows and columns** at the top of the screen.

### Use the advanced tagging mode

Advanced tagging mode allows you to tag tables at the cell level. Use this mode for complex tables like:

- Tables that are skewed, where tagging with a grid isn't possible.
- When you need to extract nested items, like an item within a cell.

Given the table from the following example, to extract the unit price, you define it as a separate column on the [Choose information to extract](create-form-processing-model.md#define-information-to-extract) step. You define **Description**, **Unit price**, **Quantity**, and **Amount** each as a column of the table and tag them accordingly using advanced tagging mode.

:::image type="content" source="media/form-processing-advanced-tagging-mode.gif" alt-text="Animation of delimit rows and columns.":::

You can start tagging in the default mode to quickly capture all rows and columns. Then switch to advanced mode to adjust each cell and tag nested items.

### Nested items in tables

You can tag items that are nested within a row by defining these as columns. Given the table from the following example, to extract the unit price, define it as a separate column on the [Choose information to extract step](create-form-processing-model.md#define-information-to-extract) earlier in this article. Define **Description**, **Unit price**, **Quantity**, and **Amount** each as a column of the table and then tag them accordingly.

:::image type="content" source="media/form-processing-tag-table-nested-items.png" alt-text="Screenshot of tagging nested items in tables.":::

### Multipage tables

If a table spans across more than one page, make sure you tag it across all the pages. Once you finish tagging the table on one page, select **This table continues on next page** and continue tagging the table on the following page. By doing this, you teach the model that the table can span across multiple pages.

:::image type="content" source="media/document-processing-tag-multipage-table-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to select the option ‘This table continues on next page’ to continue tagging a table that spans across multiple pages.":::

Once you tag all the pages where the table is present, select **Done** to mark the table as fully tagged.

You can tag complex tables that contain merged cells, nested items, borders or no borders, or unexpected elements like a coffee stain, as shown in the following example.

:::image type="content" source="media/document-processing-tag-multipage-table-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to select the option ‘Done’ once the table has been tagged in all pages.":::

> [!TIP]
> As a best practice, ensure that you upload documents for training with expected variations. For example, include samples where the entire table is on a single page and where tables span two or more pages.

### Tag checkboxes

To tag a checkbox, draw a rectangle around the checkbox you're interested in extracting and select the checkbox name that it corresponds to.

:::image type="content" source="media/form-processing-checkbox-tag.gif" alt-text="Animation of tagging a checkbox.":::

If the quality of the document is low, AI Builder might not be able to detect the checkbox. If you're unable to tag a checkbox, do the following:

1. On the panel on the right, select the three dots next to the checkbox you want to extract.
1. Select **Not available in document**.

AI Builder supports detection and extraction of selection marks such as checkboxes and radio buttons, with different markers to indicate whether the selection is marked or not.

### Field, checkbox, table, not in document or not in collection

If a field, checkbox, or table isn't present in one of the documents or in collection you've uploaded for training, select **Not available in document** or **Not available in collection** on the panel to the right next to a field, checkbox, or table.

:::image type="content" source="media/doc-processing-multiple-layout-not-available-in-collection.gif" alt-text="Animation of a field or table not in document or not in collection.":::

## Tag all documents across all collections

All the documents that you uploaded are present for you to tag. If you created multiple collections, tag all documents across all the collections.

If fields can’t be tagged in your document, go to [Fields couldn't be loaded for this document](/troubleshoot/power-platform/ai-builder/fields-could-not-be-loaded-for-this-document-error-in-form-processing) for possible resolutions.
