Enterprise data protection

We secure your data: We help protect your data with encryption at rest and in transit, rigorous physical security controls, and data isolation between tenants.​

Your data is private: We won’t use your data except as you instruct. Our commitments to privacy include support for GDPR, ISO/IEC 27018, and our Data Protection Addendum (link https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA).​

Your access controls and policies apply to Copilot: Copilot respects your identity model and permissions, inherits your sensitivity labels, applies your retention policies, supports audit of interactions, and follows your administrative settings. The specific controls and policies will vary depending on the underlying subscription plan.​
​
You're protected against AI security risks: We help safeguard against AI-focused risks such as harmful content and prompt injections.​
​
Your data isn’t used to train foundation models: Microsoft Copilot uses the user’s context to create relevant responses. Copilot for Microsoft 365 also uses Microsoft Graph data. Consistent with our other Copilot offers, prompts, responses, and data accessed through Microsoft Graph aren't used to train foundation models.​

Geo boundary compliance

Where Azure Open AI is available, customer data does not leave geo boundary.​
If Azure OpenAI is not available in a geo, admins have granular controls to manage cross geo data movement per environment.​
