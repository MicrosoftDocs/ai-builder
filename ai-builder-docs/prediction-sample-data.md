# Use sample data to do prediction

To explore the possibilities of prediction in AI Builder, you can get started by building and training a prediction model that uses sample data provided by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample data is added to your environment automatically if you enable the [Deploy sample apps and data](build-model.md#deploy-sample-apps-and-data) setting when you create your database.

## Get the sample data

You can [configure your new environment](build-model.md) to deploy sample data automatically when you create it. Or, you can download the AI Builder samples provided by Microsoft from <https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/ai-builder>. Follow the instructions in the [Data preparation](prediction-data-prep.md) topic to import the sample data into your Microsoft Dataverse environment, and then follow the instructions in [Create a prediction model](prediction-create-model.md) to create an AI model that uses this sample data.
