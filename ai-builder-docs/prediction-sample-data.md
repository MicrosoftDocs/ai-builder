# Use sample data to do prediction

To explore the possibilities of prediction in AI Builder, you can get started by building and training a prediction model using sample data provided by Microsoft.

## Get the sample data

You can [configure your new environment](build-model.md) to deploy sample data automatically when you create it. Or, you can use the AI Builder samples provided by Microsoft: <https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/ai-builder>.  Follow the instructions in the [Data preparation](prediction-data-prep.md) topic to import the sample data into your Common Data Service environment, and then follow the [Create a prediction model](prediction-create-model.md) instructions to create an AI model using this sample data.
