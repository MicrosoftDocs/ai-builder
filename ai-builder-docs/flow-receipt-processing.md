# Use the receipt processing prebuilt model in Power Automate

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **My flows** in the left pane, and then select **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.

1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **+Add an input** > **File** as the input type.

1. Replace  **File Content** with **My receipt** (also known as the title).

1. Select **+New step** > **AI Builder**, and then select **Extract information from receipts** in the list of actions.

1. Select the **Receipt file** input, and then select **My receipt** from the **Dynamic content** list:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Trigger file flow.](media/rp-flow-my-receipt.png "Manually trigger a flow screens")

1. In the successive actions, you can use any of the receipt values from the [model output](#output) section below.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Flow example.](media/rp-flow-example.png "Example flow screens")

>[!NOTE]
> Receipt values are returned as strings. To manipulate them as numbers, you can use the [float](/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#float) or [int](/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#int) conversion functions.

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses the AI Builder receipt processing model. Select **Save** on the top right, and then select **Test** to try out your flow.

## Page range

For large documents, it's possible to specify the page range to process.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Page range.](media/rp-pagerange.png "Page range example")

You can enter a page value or page range in the **Pages** parameter. Example: 1 or 3-5.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a large document with only one receipt, we strongly recommend to use the Pages parameter to aim at your receipt, and therefore reduce the cost of model prediction and increase performance. However, note that only the data of the **first receipt** within the page range will be returned and that multi-page receipts are not supported.
> 
> Example: A document contains a first receipt in page 2 and a second receipt that spans overs page 3 and 4:
> - If you enter value 2, it will return the data of the first receipt
> - If you enter value 3-4, it will only return the data of the first page of the second receipt
> - If you enter value 2-4, it will only return data of the first receipt, not the data of the second receipt
