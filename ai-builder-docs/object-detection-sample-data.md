# Use sample data to do object detection

To explore the possibilities of object detection in AI Builder, you can get started by building and training an object detection model using sample pictures and labels.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample data is added to your environment automatically if you enable the [Deploy sample apps and data](build-model.md#deploy-sample-apps-and-data) setting when you create your database.

## Get the sample data

Download [AIBuilder_Lab.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103171) file, which contains object detection sample images and labels.

> [!NOTE]
 > The AIBuilder_Lab.zip file also contains sample files for working with other AI Builder model types, in addition to some hands-on labs that you can use to learn more about AI Builder. For more information about the contents of the zip file, see the [readme.txt](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108226) file that's included in the zip file.

## Add labels in Microsoft Dataverse

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), and then select **Data** > **Tables** in the left pane.
2. Prepare a table with one column in a text format, either by using an existing table or creating a new one.
    If you need to create a new table, see [Create a table](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-create-entity).
3. On the top menu, select **Get data**.
4. In the list of data sources, select **Excel**.
5. Select **Browse** to upload your Excel workbook, and then select the sheet or sheets that your data is in.
    You might have to allow third-party cookies for your browser to complete this step.
6. On the **Edit Queries** screen, select **Transform table** > **Use first row as headers**.
7. Select **Next** > **Load to new entity**.
8. Use the drop-down menu to select your target table, and then map your columns to the destination fields.
9. Select **Next** to finish.
