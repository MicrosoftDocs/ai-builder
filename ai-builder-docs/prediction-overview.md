# Overview of the prediction model

AI Builder prediction models analyze yes/no patterns in your data. AI Builder learns to associate historical patterns with outcomes. Based on past results, the prediction model detects learned patterns in new data to predict future outcomes.

Use the prediction AI model to explore any business question that's answered as one of two available options, such as yes/no, true/false, pass/fail, and go/no-go. For example:

- Which applicants might be eligible for membership?
- Which customers might not renew their subscriptions?
- Which leads might purchase a product or service?
- Which accounts might not pay their invoices on time?
