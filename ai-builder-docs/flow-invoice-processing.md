# Use the invoice processing prebuilt model in Power Automate

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **My flows** in the left pane, and then select **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.

1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **+Add an input** > **File** as the input type.

1. Replace  **File Content** with **My invoice** (also known as the title).

1. Select **+New step** > **AI Builder**, and then select **Extract information from invoices** in the list of actions.

1. Specify **My invoice** from the trigger in the **Invoice file** input.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Trigger file flow.](media/ip-flow-my-invoice.png "Manually trigger a flow screens")

1. In the successive actions, you can use any of the invoice values from the [model output](#output).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Flow example.](media/ip-flow-example.png "Example flow screens")

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses the AI Builder invoice processing model. Select **Save** on the top right, and then select **Test** to try out your flow.

## Page range

For large documents, it's possible to specify the page range to process.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Page range.](media/ip-pagerange.png "Page range example")

You can enter a page value or page range in the **Pages** parameter. Example: 1 or 3-5.

>[!NOTE]
> If you have a large document with only one invoice, we strongly recommend to **use the Pages parameter to aim at your invoice, and therefore reduce the cost of model prediction and increase performance**. However, the page range should contain a **unique invoice** for the action to return correct data.
> 
> Example: A document contains a first invoice in page 2 and a second invoice that spans over pages 3 and 4:
> - If you enter page range 2, it will return the data of the first invoice.
> - If you enter page range 3-4, it will only return the data of the second invoice.
> - If you enter page range 2-4, it will return partial data of the first and second invoices (should be avoided).
