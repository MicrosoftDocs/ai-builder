# Data preparation

Before you create your prediction model, you'll want to make sure your data is in Microsoft Dataverse and that it's in the correct format.

## Create your custom table

Do you have data that you want to import into Dataverse for training in AI Builder? First, you have to create a table. In this example, we'll provide a solution that has predefined custom tables. To use your own data, [create a custom table](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-create-entity) and use it instead of the example used here.

> [!NOTE]
> For best results, use a dataset that is less than 1.5 GB in size. Otherwise, AI Builder will use only 1.5 GB of your data to train and predict. Because you canâ€™t control which data that exceeds the 1.5 GB limit won't be used, you should optimize your data to stay under 1.5 GB.

## Sample dataset for prediction model

1. Download the AI Builder sample dataset package:
   1. Select [AIBPredictionSample_simpledeploy_v4.21.3.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/ai-builder/AIBPredictionSample_simpledeploy_v4.21.3.zip).
   1. Select the **Download** button.

   > ![Screenshot of the download screen in GitHub.](media/prep-download.png "Download screen in GitHub")

1. Ensure that the file isn't blocked after you download. To do this:
   1. In the Downloads folder, find the downloaded zip file, right-click, and then select **Properties**.
   1. On the General tab, select the **Unblock** checkbox, and then select **Apply**.

1. Extract the .zip file, and look for **PackageDeployer.exe** in the extracted folder.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot showing PackageDeployer.exe selected.](media/prep-exe.png "The extracted folder file names")

1. Run **PackageDeployer.exe**. The following screen will appear.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select **Office 365**, and then select **Login**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of signing in to the Package Deployer.](media/prep-dp-login.png "Login to Package Deployer screen")

1. Enter the credentials that you use to sign in to the Power Apps maker portal, and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of entering your credentials.](media/prep-credentials.png "Enter your credentials screen")

1. If the sign-in is successful, you'll see the Welcome screen. Read the message, and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of installing the AI Builder prediction sample dataset.](media/prep-welcome.png "Install the AI Builder prediction sample dataset screen")

1. On the **Ready to Install** screen, make sure you're installing the solution in the correct environment and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot showing the solution package to be installed and the organization name.](media/prep-install.png "Ssreen showing the solution package to be installed and organization name")

1. On the **Reading AIB Prediction Dataset Installer Configuration** screen, read the summary information for the data and solutions being imported and then select **Next**.

   It will take a few minutes to import the data. As each step is completed successfully, you'll see a green circle with a check mark next to the step.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

1. On the **Installation Complete** screen, select **Finish**.

   > ![Screenshot showing installation complete.](media/prep-finish.png "Installation complete screen")

## How you can use the solutions you installed

The sample dataset installs two solutions in your environment. It also installs sample data for the included entities:

- **Brazilian Commerce:** Use for predicting multiple outcomes. Select **BC Orders** as the table, and **Delivery Timeliness** as the column when you pick what you want to predict.

- **AI Builder Online Shopper Intention:** Use for binary prediction and numerical prediction.
   - Select **Online Shopper Intentions** as the table, and **Revenue (Label)** as the column if you want to try out binary prediction.
   - Select **Online Shopper Intentions** as the table. Also select **ExitRates** or **BounceRates** as the column if you want to try out numerical prediction.

If you need help with creating a prediction model, follow the instructions in [Create a prediction model](prediction-create-model.md).
