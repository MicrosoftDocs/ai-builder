The image description prebuilt model analyzes an image and generates a user-friendly description based on its analysis. It's useful in a variety of scenarios:

- **Auto-captioning**: Use machine learning to generate descriptive text for images.

- **Security and surveillance**: Monitor or identify threats easily with descriptions of presence, people, or activity in a video frame.

- **Search engine optimization**: Describe the images in a web page to make the page more discoverable in searches.

- **Chatbots**: Describe an image and reason for it, which gives the illusion of a multi-modal capability.

- **Retail environment**: Describe a product to help with inventory management and restocking.
