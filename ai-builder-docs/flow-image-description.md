The image description prebuilt model analyzes an image and generates a user-friendly description based on its analysis. Use it when your flow needs to describe an image or other visual element.

## Create an image description flow

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/).

1. In the left navigation pane, select **My flows** > **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.

1. In the **Flow name** field, name your flow.

1. In the **Choose how to trigger this flow** field, select **Manually trigger a flow** > **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **Add an input** > **File**.

1. Select **New step** > **AI Builder** > **Generate description of an image (preview)**.

1. Select the **Image** field, and then select **File Content** from the **Dynamic content** list.

    :::image type="content" source="media/flow-image-description/file-content-dynamic-content-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AI Builder action Generate description of an image.":::

In successive actions, you can use any columns the model extracts.

In the following example, the **Get my profile (V2)** and **Send an email (V2)** actions are used to send the generated image description in an email.

## Test your flow

1. Select **Save**, and then select **Test**.

1. Select an image file, and then select **Import**.

    You should receive an email similar to the following example.

    Congratulations John! Your Power Automate flow ran successfully. Here is the description generated by AI Builder Image Description:
