# Interpret confidence score for tables and table cells

A confidence score for tables and cells in general documents quantifies how certain the model is about its predictions on structured data. Higher scores indicate greater confidence, while lower scores suggest uncertainty. These scores help prioritize reliable outputs, guide human review, and improve accuracy in applications like data extraction, validation, and automated reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> Confidence scores for tables, and table cells are available with the Preview version for general documents

## Use a quick test to retrieve the Confidence score value from the selected table

## Use Confidence score in a cloud flow


## Use the formula bar to retrieve the Confidence score value from the selected item in the Form Processor  control in Power Apps

In this example I have chosen to extract tabular information from my document with a Table that I named 'Table invoice' with 4 columns 'Item', 'Quantity', 'Rate' and 'Amount'

Hereâ€™s some examples

This expression retrieves the confidence value of the amount from the first row of the invoice table in the results of FormProcessor1.

```power-fx
First(FormProcessor1.Results.'Table invoice').Amount.Confidence
```

This expression retrieves the confidence value from the first item in the results of the `FormProcessor1` and multiplies it by 100 to convert it to a percentage format.

```power-fx
First(FormProcessor1.Results.'Table invoice').Item.Confidence *100
```

This expression concatenates the rounded confidence values of amounts in the invoice table, appending a percentage sign and a newline character after each value.

```power-fx
Concat(FormProcessor1.Results.'Table invoice', Round(Amount.Confidence * 100,2) & "%", Char(10))
```
