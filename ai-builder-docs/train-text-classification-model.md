# Train your category classification model

Before you can use your category classification model, you have to train it to perform the way you want. After you train your model, publish it to make it available to other people.

## Train

You're now ready to run your training. Review your configuration, and then select **Train my AI** to begin training your category classification model. When it's ready, you'll be notified.

You can also train a new version of your model. Select **New version** > **From published version**. This creates a new draft of your model that you can configure and train.
