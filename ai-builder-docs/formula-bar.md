# Add text-based AI models using formulas (Preview)

You can integrate some AI Builder models in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com) by using the formula bar. Currently, this functionality is available only for the following AI Builder model types:

* Sentiment analysis
* Entity extraction
* Key phrase extraction
* Language detection

For information on how to use formulas to add these AI models to your Power Apps, see [Use formulas for text AI models (Preview)](use-model.md#use-formulas-for-text-ai-models-preview)
