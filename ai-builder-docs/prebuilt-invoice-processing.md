# Invoice processing prebuilt AI model

The invoice processing prebuilt AI model extracts key invoice data to help automate the processing of invoices. The invoice processing model is optimized to recognize common invoice elements like invoice ID, invoice date, amount due, and more.

The **Invoices** model allows you to augment the default behavior by building a [custom Invoices model](create-form-processing-model.md#select-the-type-of-document).

## Key-value pairs

Key-value pairs are all the identified labels or keys and their associated responses or values. You can use these to extract additional values that aren't part of the predefined list of fields.

To visualize all key-value pairs detected by the invoice processing model, you can add a **Create HTML table** action in your cloud flow as shown in the screenshot and run the cloud flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/invoice-processing-kvp-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot of all key-value pairs on an invoice - results.":::

To extract a specific key for which you know its value, you can use the **Filter array** action as shown on the following screenshot. In the example of the screenshot, we want to extract the value for the key **Tel .:**

## Create a custom invoice processing solution

The invoice processing prebuilt AI model is designed to extract common fields found in invoices. Because every business is unique, you might want to extract fields other than those included in this prebuilt model. It can also be the case that some standard fields aren't well extracted for a particular type of invoice you work with. To address this, there are two options:

- **Use the custom Invoices processing model**: Augment the behaviors of the prebuilt invoice processing model by adding new fields to be extracted in addition to the ones by [default](prebuilt-invoice-processing.md#model-output), or samples of documents not properly extracted. To learn how to augment the prebuilt invoice processing model, go to [Select the type of document](create-form-processing-model.md#select-the-type-of-document).

- **View raw OCR results**: Every time the invoice processing prebuilt AI model processes a file you provide, it also does an OCR operation to extract every word written on the file. You can access the raw OCR results on the detected text output provided by the model. A simple search on the content returned by detected text might be enough to get the data you need.

- **Use document processing**: With AI Builder, you can also build your own custom AI model to extract specific fields and tables you need for the documents you work with. Just [create a document processing model](form-processing-model-overview.md) and train it to extract all the information from an invoice that doesn’t work well with the invoice extraction model.

Once you train your custom document processing model, you can combine it with the invoice processing prebuilt model in a Power Automate cloud flow.

Here are some examples:

### Use a custom document processing model to extract additional fields that aren't returned by the invoice processing prebuilt model

In this example, we trained a custom document processing model to extract a *loyalty program number*, only present in invoices from providers Adatum and Contoso.

The cloud flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls the invoice processing prebuilt AI model to extract its data. Next, we check if the vendor for the invoice that was processed is either from Adatum or Contoso. If it's the case, we then call a custom document processing model that we trained to get that loyalty number. Finally, we save the extracted data from the invoice in an Excel file.

### Use a custom document processing model if the confidence score for a field returned by the invoice processing prebuilt model is low

In this example, we trained a custom document processing model to extract the total amount from invoices where we usually get a low confidence score when using the invoice processing prebuilt model.

The cloud flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls the invoice processing prebuilt AI model to extract its data. Next, we check if the confidence score for the *Invoice total value* property is less than 0.65. If it’s the case, we then call a custom document processing model that we trained with invoices where we usually get a low confidence score for the total field. Finally, we save the extracted data from the invoice into an Excel file.

### Use the invoice processing prebuilt model to handle invoices that a custom document processing model isn't trained to handle

One way to use the invoice processing prebuilt model is to use it as a fallback model to handle invoices that you didn't train in your custom document processing model. For example, let's say you built a document processing model, and trained it to extract data from your top 20 invoice providers. You could then use the invoice processing prebuilt model to process all new invoices or lower volume invoices. Here’s an example of how you could do it:

This cloud flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls a custom document processing model to extract its data. Next, we check if the confidence score for the detected collection is less than 0.65. If it’s the case, it probably means the provided invoice isn't a good match for the custom model. We then call the prebuilt invoice processing model. Finally, we save the extracted data from the invoice in an Excel file.
