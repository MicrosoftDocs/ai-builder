# Overview of AI Builder

With AI Builder, a Microsoft Power Platform feature, you can create and use AI models that optimize your business processes. You can either use a *prebuilt* model that is ready for many common business scenarios, or create a *custom* model that meets your needs. AI Builder helps your business to automate processes and gain insights from your data in [Power Apps](use-in-powerapps-overview.md) and [Power Automate](use-in-flow-overview.md).

- Explore AI Builder in [Power Automate](use-in-flow-overview.md).

- Explore AI Builder in [Power Apps](use-in-powerapps-overview.md).

## Add intelligence to your business

Integration with Power Apps and Power Automate makes using AI easy.

To add intelligence to your business:

1. **Choose an AI model type**: Select the model type that suits your business need. Choose from a growing set of AI solutions. Refer to the [no code AI cheat sheet](#download-ai-builder-no-code-ai-cheat-sheet) for guidance.

1. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from the available options.

1. **Tailor your AI model**: You can adjust custom models to enhance your AI's performance.

1. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic process. It teaches your AI model how to resolve your business problem (for example, how to recognize your products on an image) based on your business data and tailoring. When trained, your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction, or the list and number of objects detected in an image.

1. **Use insights from your AI model**: Use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs, even if you have no coding skills. For example, you can create a flow that automates document processing in Power Automate or an app in Power Apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance.
