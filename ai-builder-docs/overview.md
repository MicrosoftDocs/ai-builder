# What is AI Builder?

AI Builder is a new Power Platform capability that helps you improve business performance by automating processes and predicting outcomes. AI Builder is a turnkey solution that brings the power of AI through a point-and-click experience. With AI Builder, you can add intelligence to your apps even if you have no coding or data science skills.

## How can I add intelligence to my apps?

Using AI is easy thanks to integration with Power Apps and Microsoft Power Automate. Adding intelligence to your business is simple:

1. **Choose AI model type**: Use the model type that suits your business need. Choose from a growing set of AI solutions.
1. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from Common Data Service. AI Builder does the hard work for you thanks to the Common Data Model.
1. **Tailor your AI model**: Filter your data, set scheduling, and tweak the AI model to optimize how your AI performs.
1. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic process where AI Builder “teaches” your AI model how to resolve your business problem (for example, recognize your products on an image) thanks to your business data and tailoring. When trained, your AI model can generate insights, such as the result of a prediction or the list and number of objects detected in an image.
1. **Use your AI model’s insights**: Use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs, even if you have no coding skills.  For example, create a flow that automates document processing in Power Automate Or, create an app in Power Apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance.
