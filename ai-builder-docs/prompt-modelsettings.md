# Model selection and temperature settings

When you create a custom prompt in prompt builder, the panel on the right includes a **Settings** section. This section allows you to set these parameters:

- Version of the generative AI model
- Temperature

This article explores the impact of these parameters.

## Version of generative AI model

The dropdown menu allows you to select among the generative AI models, which generate the answer to your custom prompt.

The default model is a GA (generally available) GPT model. As of May 2024, it's GPT 3.5. Previous prompts created in prompt builder rely on this default model.

The exact version is GPT 3.5 turbo 0125. GPT 3.5 model is consuming AI Builder credits when used in Power Apps or Power Automate.

The other available model is GPT 4. As long as it's in preview, it doesn't consume AI Builder credits when used in Power Apps or Power Automate. As a preview model, its use is linked to the AI Builder preview toggle in environment settings. To get there, sign in to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments) and select **Environment** > **Settings** > **Features**.

When preview models are Off, GPT 4 can't be selected in the dropdown menu, and prompts previously created with GPT 4 are blocked. The exact version is subject to change. Depending on the region availability, it uses the GPT-4o version.

### Choose a model

Choose between the models based on status, licensing rules, and functionalities.

|GPT model  |Status  |Version |Licensing rules   | Functionalities| Regions availabilities |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|GPT 3.5| GA - Default model | gpt-3.5-turbo-0125	| Consumes credits in Power Apps and Power Automate. More information: [Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130)  | Trained on data up to Sept 2021. Context allowed up to 16k tokens | [Feature availability by Regions for prompts](availability-region.md)
| GPT 4 | Preview | gpt-4-32k-0613 | Free while in Preview | Trained on data up to Sept 2021. Context allowed up to 32k tokens. Multilingual enhanced proficiency. Better than GPT 3.5 in technical redaction and creativity.|	[Feature availability by Regions for prompts](availability-region.md)
| GPT 4 | Preview | gpt-4o	| Free while in Preview | GPT-4o has knowledge up to October 2023 and has a context length of 128k tokens. Multilingual enhanced proficiency. Better than GPT 3.5 in technical redaction and creativity. | <ul> <li>United States and other United States based regions July 10, 2024.</li> <li>Europe and other Europe based regions July 15, 2024</li> <li>Other Regions TBD.</li>

### Use of AI prompts in context of Microsoft Copilot Studio

AI prompts don't consume AI Builder credits when in the context of Copilot Studio, but consume messages when they're built on a GA GPT model.

To learn more about message consumption, go to [Power Platform licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).

## Temperature

The slider allows you to select the temperature of the generative AI model. It varies between 0 and 1, and guides the generative AI model about how much creativity (1) vs deterministic answer (0) it should provide.

Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output generated by the AI model. A lower temperature results in more predictable and conservative outputs. To compare, a higher temperature allows for more creativity and diversity in the responses. It’s a way to fine-tune the balance between randomness and determinism in the model’s output.

By default temperature is 0, as in previously created prompts.

|Temperature  |Functionality| Use in|
|---------|---------|---------|
|0| More predictable and conservative outputs.<br>Responses are more consistent.| Prompts that require high accuracy and less variability.|
|1| More creativity and diversity in the responses. <br> More varied and sometimes more innovative responses.| Prompts that create new out-of-the-box content |

While adjusting the temperature can influence the model’s output, it doesn’t guarantee a specific result. The AI’s responses are inherently probabilistic and can vary even with the same temperature setting.
