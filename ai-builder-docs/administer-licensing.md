# AI Builder licensing


AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your PowerApps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license. This means you can start your AI Builder trial after you have a PowerApps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license that allows you to create a Common Data Service environment.  

For detailed information about AI Builder licensing:

- [Microsoft PowerApps and Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085130&clcid=0x409)
- [AI Builder licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#ai-builder)

## Preview features and trial licenses

Want to get started using AI Builder? Use premium features for a limited time with a trial license, or use preview features without obtaining a license at all.

### Preview features

AI Builder features that are in preview release status are free to use. You do not need to obtain a license to use preview features in AI Builder.

### Trial licenses

An AI Builder trial license enables you to use  AI Builder for free for the duration of the trial period.

What you get with an AI Builder trial license:

- The ability to create and use AI models in any PowerApps environment (trial or production), because the AI Builder trial license is applicable at the user level, not at the environment level.
- Access to store  your AI model results in Common Data Service.
- The capability to add intelligence to your organization by utilizing your AI model results in PowerApps and Power Automate.

> [!NOTE]
> Your trial licenses is specific to a user, not an environment. If you already have an environment with PowerApps license (free or paid), you can use that environment or create a new one for your AI Builder trial.

For more information about trial licenses:

- [PowerApps](https://signup.microsoft.com/Start?sku=powerapps)
- [Power Automate](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/)

### After the trial expires:

- Trial environments expire after 30 days.
- Once you purchase an AI Builder license, the usage will be limited to environments where the administrator allocates AI capacity.

> [!NOTE]  
> These restrictions apply only to model types that have been released to  general availability. Model types in preview release status will remain available without a license until they are released for general availability.  

## Paid licenses and capacity allocation

First, you have to purchase AI Builder capacity add-on for your PowerApps or Power Automate licenses. Then, an administrator has to allocate that capacity to any PowerApps environment where you want to use AI Builder.

### AI Builder paid licenses

After your AI Builder trial license expires:

- You have to [purchase a license](/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin) to continue using your AI models
- An administrator has to assign AI Builder capacity to any environment where you want to use AI Builder.
- You can't create or modify AI Builder models, and no new inference will be possible when the trial expires if you don't purchase a license.

### Allocate AI Builder capacity

Because AI Builder is licensed as a capacity add-on to your existing PowerApps and Power Automate licenses, an administrator has to allocate capacity for AI Builder to the environment before you can use it. Information about how to allocate capacity in the Power Platform Admin Center is available [here](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on).
