# AI Builder licensing

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your PowerApps or Flow licenses. This means you can start your AI Builder trial after you have a PowerApps or Flow license that allows you to create a Common Data Service instance.  

## Preview features

AI Builder features that are in preview release status are free to use. You do not need to obtain a license to use preview features in AI Builder.

## Trial licenses

An AI Builder trial license enables you to use  AI Builder  for free for the duration of the trial period.

What you get with an AI Builder trial license:

- Create and use AI models in any environment (trial or production), because the AI Builder trial license is applicable at the user level, not environment level.
- Store  your AI model results in Common Data Service
- Use AI model results in your PowerApps, Flows, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Your trial licenses is specific to a user, not an environment. If you already have an environment with PowerApps license (free or paid), you can use that environment or create a new one for your AI Builder trial.

### After the trial expires:

- Trial environments expire after 30 days.
- Once you purchase an AI Builder license, the usage will be limited to environments where the administrator allocates AI capacity.

> [!NOTE]  
> These restrictions apply only to model types that have been released to  general availability. Model types in preview release status will remain available without a license until they are released for general availability.  

## AI Builder paid license

- You need to [purchase a license](/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin) to continue using your AI models, and to assign AI credits to an environment.
- You can't create or modify AI Builder models, and no new inference will be possible when the trial expires if you don't purchase a license.
