# Feature availability by region

AI Builder was initially released in Europe and the United States. Other regions continue to be added; however, the availability and release status of AI Builder features vary by location.

## Which region does my AI Builder subscription belong to?

Your AI Builder models are deployed in the region that hosts your Microsoft Power Platform environment. For example, if your environment is created in the Europe region, your AI Builder models are deployed in data centers in Europe and are subject to the availability status for Europe.  

## Availability and release status of features by region

The following tables show which AI Builder features are available in each region, and the release status (general availability or preview) for each feature. A dash (-) indicates that the feature isn't available.

> [!NOTE]
> For a view of what's planned for AI Builder, including new features, release status, and regional availability, go to the [AI Builder release plans](/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/ai-builder/).
