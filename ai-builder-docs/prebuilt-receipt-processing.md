# Receipt processing prebuilt model

Receipt processing is a prebuilt model that uses state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) to detect printed and handwritten text and extract key information from receipts.

## Use in Power Apps

The receipt processing prebuilt model is available in Power Apps by using the receipt processor component. For more information, see [Use the receipt processor component in Power Apps](prebuilt-receipt-processor-component-in-powerapps.md).

## Use in Power Automate

For information on how to use the receipt processing prebuilt model in Power Automate, see [Use the receipt processing prebuilt model in Power Automate](flow-receipt-processing.md).  

## Supported languages, markets, and files

English sales receipts from Australia, Canada, United States, Great Britain, and India are supported.

To get the best results, provide one clear photo or scan per receipt.

- The image format must be JPEG, PNG, or PDF.
- The file size must be less than 50 MB.
- The image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.
