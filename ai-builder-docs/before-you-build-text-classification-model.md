# Before you build a text classification model

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Before you build your text classification model, you'll need to make sure your data is in Common Data Service, and in the correct format.

## Prerequisites

 - Training data should be in a Common Data Service entity.
 - Make sure your administrator has assigned you a security role with read privilege over the training data.
 - You have appropriate permissions to create entities in your Common Data Service environment.
 - AI Builder text classification supports the following languages: English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. If you try to classify text items in other languages, your model might not work properly. 

## Data format

 - Text and tags should be stored in text fields under the same entity. 
 - Tags should be separated using a delimiter. We currently support the following delimiters: comma ( , ), semicolon ( ; ), tab, and no separator. 
 - Tags that contain fewer than 50 text items are ignored.
 - Text must be fewer than 5,000 characters.

If we represent data in a table, it would look like this:

| Text      | Tags                |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Text data | Tag X, Tag Y        | 
| Text data | Tag X, Tag Y, Tag Z | 

## Import your data into Common Data Service

We understand that your data might not be in Common Data Service. However, Common Data Service includes a powerful set of connectors that will help you import your data from all major data sources. For more information about how to import data into Common Data Service, see [Add data to an entity in Common Data Service by using Power Query](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-cds-newentity-pq). 

As an example, here is how to import training data from an Excel sheet. This example uses an Excel file like this:

|   |   |   | 
|---|---|---|
|326589    |It’s a powerful tool that helps make quick changes   |Good \| Quick \| Powerful |
|326590    |This program is great and has lots of potential. The user interface is intuitive and makes it easy to filter results. However, when I try to edit a link, I get an error.    |Potential, Easy \| Good, Ease of Use \| filters \| bug  |
|326591    | You need to work on your Feature Y capabilities, they are not as good as your competition. |Feature Y \| Competition     |
|326592    |Easy to view data        |Easy \| Ease of use                                |
|326593    |I like how you made feature X easy to use. This reduces a lot of complexity when I want to onboard new customers. | Easy \|  Good \| Feature X                             |

Note that the tags data is separated using a vertical bar or pipe ( \| ).

1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/), and then select the down arrow to expand **Data** in the navigation pane.
2. Under **Data** > **Entities** > **Get data**. 
    - If you need to create a new entity, use [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-create-entity).
3. In the list of data sources, select **Excel**.
4. Select **Browse** to upload your Excel file,  and then select the sheet or sheets your data is in.
    - You might have to allow third-party cookies for your browser to perform this step.
6. On the **Edit Queries** screen, select **Transform table** > **Use first row as headers**. Next, select the **Tags** column, and then select **Transform Column** > **Replace values**.
1. Replace the vertical bar ( \| ) character with a semicolon ( ; ) and then select **OK**.
1. Now that your data is in the correct format, select **Next** > **Load to new entity**.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select your target entity, and then map your columns to the destination field. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Map your columns to the destination field](media/create-text-model-map-columns.png)

1. Select **Refresh manually** on the **Refresh settings** page. 

You’re all set—Power Query will import your data into the Common Data Service entity you have picked.
