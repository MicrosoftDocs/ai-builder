# Use an AI Builder custom entity extraction AI model in Power Automate

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/).

1. Select **My flows** in the left pane, and then select **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.

1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **+Add an input** > **Text** as the input type.

1. Replace the word **Input** with **My Text** (also known as the title).

1. Select **+ New step** > **AI Builder**, and then select **Extract entities from text with one of your custom models** in the list of actions.

1. Select the entity extraction model you want to use, and in the **Text** column add **My Text** from the trigger.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows selected model content.](media/flow-eec-overview.png "Select model content")

1. In the successive actions, you can use any columns and tables extracted by the AI Builder model. The following example saves each inferred **Entity type**, **Entity value** and **Confidence score** into an Excel table.

    > ![Entity extraction cloud flow example.](media/flow-eec-example.png "Entity extraction cloud flow example")

Congratulations! You created a cloud flow that uses an AI Builder entity extraction model. Select **Save** on the top right, and then select **Test** to try out your cloud flow.
