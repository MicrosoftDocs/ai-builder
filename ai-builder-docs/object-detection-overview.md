# Overview of the object detection model

Object detection can help expedite or automate business processes. In retail, it can help streamline inventory management, allowing retail leaders to focus on onsite customer relationships. In manufacturing, technicians can use it to speed the repair process by quickly accessing the manual for a piece of machinery for which the UPC/serial number isn't obvious.

Organizations of any size can use AI Builder object detection to add these capabilities for their own custom objects to their apps.
