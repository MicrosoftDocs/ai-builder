# Preview: Overview of object detection model

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Object detection can help expedite or automate business processes. In retail, it could help streamline inventory management, allowing retail leaders to focus on on-site customer relationships. In manufacturing, technicians could use it to speed the repair process to quickly access the manual for a piece of machinery for which the UPC/serial number isn’t obvious.  

AI Builder object detection allows organizations of any size to add these capabilities for their own custom objects to their apps.
