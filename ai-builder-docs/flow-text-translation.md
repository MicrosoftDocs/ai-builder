# Use the text translation prebuilt model in Power Automate

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **My flows** in the left pane, and then select **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.

1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.

1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **+Add an input** > **Text** as the input type.

1. Replace  **Input** with **My Text** (also known as the title).

1. Select **+ New step** > **AI Builder**, and then select **Translate text into another language** in the list of actions.

1. Select **My Text** from the **Dynamic content** list.

1. Select the target language in the **Translate to** input.

1. Optionally, select the source language in the **Translate from** input to specify the language of the text in **My Text** input. If you don't specify this input, the model will automatically detect the source language for you.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Trigger text translation flow.](media/trigger-text-translation.png "Trigger text translation flow")
