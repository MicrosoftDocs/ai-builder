## Requirements

Document processing works on input documents that meet the following requirements:

- JPG, PNG, or PDF format (text or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are better, because there won't be any errors in character extraction and location.
- TIFF files can't be used for training. You'll need to use documents in PDF, JPG or PNG format to train a model. Once the model has been trained, it can extract data from TIFF files when the model is used in a Power Automate cloud flow.
- If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submitting them.
- Maximum document size to process must not exceed 20 MB. 
- For images, dimensions must be between 50 &times; 50 and 10,000 &times; 10,000 pixels.
- If scanned from paper documents, scans should be high-quality images.
- You can create up to 200 collections per model.
- In a cloud flow, the limit of fields that can be tagged for document processing is 300.

 > [!NOTE]
 > - Extracting signatures from documents isn't currently supported.<br />
 > 
 > - Fields that split across page boundaries aren't currently supported.
