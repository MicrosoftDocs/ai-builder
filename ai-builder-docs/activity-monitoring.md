# Monitor AI Builder models and prompts activity

As you use your AI models and prompts, you might have to access data to monitor their activity or consumption.

The **Monitor activity** section of the AI hub in the Power Automate portal provides tables that you can use to monitor AI models and prompts. You can also monitor the data that they process, and track their consumption.

## View AI Builder activity

The **AI Builder activity** page shows AI model and prompts activity, including activity generated in Power Automate, Power Apps and Microsoft Copilot Studio.

Learn more in [What is Power Apps?](/power-apps/powerapps-overview) and [Copilot Studio overview](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. On the navigation pane to the left, select **AI hub**.
1. Select **Monitor activity**.
1. (Optional) Review the acitivity on the page and customize the data that shows by filtering the timeframe or tool type.

   By default, data displays for all AI models from the last seven days.

    Legend:

    1. **Processed time**: The time when processing occurs.
    1. **Tool name**: The AI model or prompt name.
    1. **Input**: The text input of the AI model `predict` action for text processing models, or the value **Image** or **Document** for other models and prompts.
    1. **Output**: The GPT prompt output (model response) in the selected output format.
    1. **Used in**: The consumption source of the AI model or prompt. It can be Power Automate, Power Apps, Copilot Studio, or Quick Test for saved but not consumed prompts.
    1. **Consumption**: The numeric consumption value for the related AI model or prompt run.

      More details show when you select each event in the table.

        Legend:

        1. **Processed by**: The name of the person who performs the predict action. This person is typically the owner of the Power Automate cloud flow or the person who runs the app created in Power Apps.
        1. **Model**: The name of the language model used in the prompt run.

## Monitor data for makers and admins

The **AI Builder activity** section is helpful if you want to monitor the use of your AI models and prompts. It's also helpful for environment admins who want to monitor all activity in an environment.

> [!NOTE]
> - The monitoring data is stored in the **AI Event** table in your Dataverse instance. It persists in the table even if you delete the model, flow, and app.
> - You're required to have Write access to this table to record AI model and prompt activity.
> - The **AI Event** Dataverse table contains input of the AI model predict actions for text scenarios only.

The data that you can display depends on your role.

| Role | What you can display |
|---|---|
| System Administrator | All activity for all AI models. |
| System Customizer | All activity for all AI models. |
| Basic User | Only your own activity for the AI models that you have access to. |
| Environment Maker | Only your own activity for the AI models that you have access to. |

## Manage AI Builder activity monitoring data

Through effective management of the historical data that your Power Automate flows, Power Apps, or other Microsoft Power Platform products generate, you ensure that your Dataverse environments remain efficient and cost-effective. By implementing data retention policies and using features such as [bulk record deletion in Dataverse](/power-platform/admin/delete-bulk-records) and [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), you can proactively manage the accumulation of historical data.

This section of the article explains how to identify the historical AI Builder activity monitoring data that can be purged from your environment. It then explains how to use Dataverse's built-in bulk-delete feature to purge it. With the bulk-delete feature, you can quickly and easily [remove large amounts of data](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/delete-data-bulk) from your environment in a way that complies with your specific data retention policies. This approach ensures efficient data storage and performance management.

In addition to on-demand bulk-delete jobs, you can schedule recurrent bulk-delete jobs that find and delete records in a table that are, for example, older than a specified number of days (`OlderThanXDays` query function).

To create bulk-delete jobs in Dataverse, you must have the **Bulk Delete** privilege in at least one of the roles that is assigned to you.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you delete Dataverse data, it is permanently deleted from your environment. There's no way to recover individual records after you delete them.

### Export a Dataverse table

The following table shows an AI Builder activity monitoring Dataverse table that might have large data volumes.

| Display name | System name | Details |
|--------|--------|--------|
| AI Event | Msdyn\_aievent | The **AI Event** table stores activity data about AI model and prompt activity. This data includes the processed data type, processed data information for text scenarios, processing date, processing status, and consumption. |

As the data is stored in your **AI Event** Dataverse table, you can export it in comma-separated values (CSV) format. Learn how to export data in [Import data from Excel and export data to CSV](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-import-export#export-data0).

### Delete AI Builder activity monitoring data

To delete AI Builder activity monitoring data, you must create a bulk-delete job. To bulk-delete data in Dataverse, follow these steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> Bulk-delete operations are irreversible. Before you perform bulk-delete operations, thoroughly test and review your filter results.

1. Sign in to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Environments**, select your environment, and then select **Settings** on the top menu bar.
1. Select **Data management** \> **Bulk deletion**.
1. Select **New** on the command bar above the **All Bulk Deletion System Jobs** grid. The **Bulk Deletion Wizard** appears, where you define a query for the records that you want to delete.
1. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Look for** list, select the **AI Events** table.
1. In the search criteria area, add the filter that should return the records that you want to delete. For example, the filter in the following screenshot finds all AI Builder model activity that is older than six months.

    :::image type="content" source="media/activity-monitoring/search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of search criteria.":::

1. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the bulk-delete job (for example, *Bulk-delete of AI models monitoring data older than 6 months*).
1. In the **At scheduled time** section, select a start date and time for the job. Select a time when users aren't typically online.
1. Select the **Run this job after every** checkbox.
1. In the **days** list, select the frequency that you want the job to run at.
1. If you want to receive a notification email, select the **Send an email to me (\<*your email address*\>) when this job is finished** checkbox.
1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Review and Submit Bulk Deletion Details** page, review the bulk-delete job, and then select **Submit** to create the recurring job.
