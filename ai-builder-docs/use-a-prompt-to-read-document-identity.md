# Create a canvas app to develop a document identity reader that utilizes prompts

This sample allows you to explore a canvas app that extracts information from identity documents, such as a U.S. passport or a French identity card, using a prompt and a Dataverse table.

# Prerequisite: 

- Active Power Apps plan
- AI Builder credits
- Dataverse environment

Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/). or [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

On the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**, select **Import Solution**

Select **Browse** for the solution file to import ["Documentidentityreader_1_0_0_1.zip"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2301870), select **Next**, select **Import**
(it may takes a few minutes to import the solution)

On the left navigation pane, select **Tables**, you should have a table called "Table document identity"

On the left navigation pane, select **... More**, select **AI hub**, select **Prompts**, select **My Prompts**, you should have a prompt called 'Document identity reader'
