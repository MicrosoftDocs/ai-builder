# Get started with copilot

Prompt Builder is the  authoring tool for creating AI prompts within Microsoft Power Platform. A better written prompt generalizes well and leads to better outcomes. To help you move faster and reduce the time spent writing prompts from scratch, you can now use Copilot to draft your prompts directly within the tool. Copilot provides intelligent suggestions based on your intent, helping you frame effective prompts while applying prompt engineering best practices. Whether you're designing prompts for summarizing data or generating natural language responses, Copilot gives you a high-quality starting point aligned with your solution goals. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - AI Builder prompts are running on LLM models powered by [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/whats-new).
> - This capability is [limited to some regions](availability-region.md#prompts).
> - This capability might be subject to usage limits or capacity throttling.

This feature empowers makers of all skill levels to create reliable and well-structured prompts quickly, accelerating your agent, app or workflow development and helping you focus on business outcomes instead of prompt syntax. You can take benefit of copilot prompt draft on all the prompt builder surfaces.
