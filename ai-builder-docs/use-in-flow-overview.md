# AI Builder in Power Automate overview

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. More information: [Power Automate docs](/power-automate)

 > [!NOTE]
 > For any AI Builder action in a cloud flow, ensure that you leave the default **Asynchronous Pattern** setting to **On**. This ensures that results from the AI models are returned properly.

## Prebuilt AI models you can use in Power Automate right away

* [Business card reader model](flow-business-card-reader.md)
* [Category classification model](prebuilt-category-classification-pwr-automate.md)
* [Entity extraction model](prebuilt-entity-extraction-pwr-automate.md)
* [ID reader model (preview)](prebuilt-id-reader.md)
* [Key phrase extraction model](flow-key-phrase-extraction.md)
* [Language detection model](flow-language-detection.md)
* [Receipt processing model (preview)](flow-receipt-processing.md)
* [Sentiment analysis model](flow-sentiment-analysis.md)
* [Text recognition model](flow-text-recognition.md)
* [Text translation model](flow-text-translation.md)

## Custom AI models that you build and train

* [Category classification model](text-classification-model-in-flow.md)
* [Entity extraction model](entity-extraction-pwr-automate.md)
* [Document processing model](form-processing-model-in-flow.md)
* [Object detection model](object-detection-model-in-flow.md)
* [Prediction model](prediction-pwr-automate.md)

## Predict action

You can use the predict action in Power Automate with many different model types. For more information, see [Use the predict action in Power Automate](predict-action-pwr-automate.md).

## Power Automate AI Builder action

This table helps you identify which capabilities are associated with each AI Builder action.

Each AI Builder capability has a different rate. Get the latest rate card information in [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide (pdf)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085130).
